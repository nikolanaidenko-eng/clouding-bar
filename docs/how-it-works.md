# How it works

The [README](../README.md) has the short version.

```

- Claude Code's [hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) — the
  plugin's, or ours in `~/.claude/settings.json` (never both at once) — tell the app
  when a session starts and stops, when Claude works, which tools and
  subagents run, and when it needs a permission or an answer. For those,
  the hook waits for your choice and hands it back to Claude — or steps
  aside within two seconds if the app isn't running.
- The **status line** brings the 5-hour limit and the context; in VS Code,
  the wrapper does. The session's **transcript** adds the model, token
  counts and lines changed.
- The chat shown is the one in front: by its title in the window (VS Code's
  chat tab, the terminal's title), by its terminal tab (Terminal, iTerm),
  else the one you picked or followed last.
- Buttons and chat lines are typed into the chat in front, the
  way you would.

The protocol is written down in [protocol.md](protocol.md).

## Development

```sh
make            # build the app and the helpers into build/
make install    # …and install them
make test       # core checks
make snapshots  # every screen as PNGs in build/snapshots
make demo       # docs/demo.gif, recorded from animated scenes (tools/demo)
make release    # universal, Developer ID-signed, notarized .dmg (see packaging/release.sh)
```

Plain `swiftc`, no Xcode project. Sources: `Sources/CloudingBar` (the app),
`Sources/CloudingBarHook` (the hook), `Sources/CloudingBarTap` (the VS Code
wrapper's tap), `Sources/CloudingBarKey` (the Keychain helper).
